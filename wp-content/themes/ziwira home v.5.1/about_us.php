					<div class="head3">It’s fitting that the word “ziwira” is Babylonian for greenhouse </div>

					<p> because, in a way, that’s what we are. A greenhouse is a transparent structure that creates an environment where it’s possible to grow healthy plants all year round. </p>

					<p>Ziwira prides itself on transparency and being structured to easily help people find healthy ways 
					to live and grow consciously. </p>
